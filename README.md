# Random YouTube Video

Since YouTube API doesn't provide any simple method to get a random YouTube video, this will search with different random strings and get a random item from the results.

## Prerequisites

Needs a YouTube Data API key, to be configured in Google Developper Console.
Once you obtain the YouTube Data API key, paste in `example_config.json` and rename the file `config.json` .
